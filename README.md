1- The endpoint did not have a description of the cards, it was added manually, I also added a container so that it was always centered (minimum margins) the logo was a . gif but in the design it was static so I directly used the one from figma respecting the design 
2- I added a skeleton just to improve the ux because I am loading the previous data
3- I found that in some places the padding was asymmetrical (eg. on one side 42px on the other 43px) I don't know if it was appropriate but I left them at 42 to make it symmetrical.
4- The Our Blog button according to the design has a 16px semibold "Manrope" font that was not in the font list, I unified it following the other buttons 
5- I made a basic function for the hamburger menu because I didn't know how it should behave
6- The hover is applied to both buttons because it was not clear to me what was meant by "2nd one on the list".
