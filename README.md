## Project: Project Description

### Installation Requirements

1. Make sure you have **Node.js** installed on your environment.
   - If you don't have Node.js installed, you can download it from: https://nodejs.org/
2. Install the project dependencies using **npm**.
   - Command: `npm install`
3. To run the project and see it in your browser, use the following command:
   - Command: `npm run start`

### Changes Made

1. **Card Descriptions:**
   - The endpoint did not provide descriptions for the cards, so I added them manually.
   - A container was added to ensure they are always centered with minimal margins.

2. **Logo:**
   - The logo was in `.gif` format, but the design specified it as static. I used the static version from Figma to match the design.

3. **Skeleton Loader:**
   - A skeleton loader was added to improve the user experience (UX) during the data preloading process.

4. **Padding Adjustments:**
   - Asymmetric padding was found in some places (e.g., 42px on one side, 43px on the other). These were adjusted to 42px for symmetry.

5. **Font for "Our Blog" Button:**
   - According to the design, the "Our Blog" button had the "Manrope" font, semibold, 16px, but it was not listed in the available fonts. I unified it with the other buttons to maintain consistency.

6. **Hamburger Menu:**
   - A basic function was created for the hamburger menu since its behavior was not specified.

7. **Hover Effect on Buttons:**
   - The hover effect was applied to both buttons since it wasn't clear which one was meant by "2nd one on the list."
